    "This filter is a form of the g-h filter. Here we are using the percentages for the errors to implicitly compute the $g$ and $h$ parameters. We could express the discrete Bayes algorithm as a g-h filter, but that would obscure the logic of this filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} \\bar {\\mathbf x} &= \\mathbf x \\ast f_{\\mathbf x}(\\bullet)\\, \\, &\\text{Predict Step} \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf x &= \\|\\mathcal L \\cdot \\bar{\\mathbf x}\\|\\, \\, &\\text{Update Step}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal L$ is the usual way to write the likelihood function, so I use that. The $\\|\\|$ notation denotes taking the norm. We need to normalize the product of the likelihood with the prior to ensure $x$ is a probability distribution that sums to one.\n",
